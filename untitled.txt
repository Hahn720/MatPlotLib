1. The initial Observation would be the obvious one, Urban environments have a commanding hold on all fronts with the exception of average fare cost. Thus with more drivers, and likely(but with more data required)a smaller area to travel, costs will be lower as a result. With denser populations and smaller areas, it is likely the cause for more reasons to utilize this service.

2. Second would be the overlap in suburban and urban areas. With many people living in areas where these two sectors would overlap, it is likely that costs go up for distance and number of available customers, but are still an option for these individuals for transportation. Thus the corralating data would make sense and further back this theory up. 

3. The final observation would be focused on rural areas. With the overall layout of the scatter plot we can see a trend of average fare cost go up from the transition of urban to rural. With few ride request, fewer number of drivers, it makes sesne that cost would go up to maintain operation of the service. All three of these points to different areas of focus with each segment. Some examples would be to obtain more drivers for rural areas (data pending), a means of bridging the gap between urban and suburban, and increasing ride counts for urban areas. These all need more data to further support, but it opens up an avenue where more focus can be given for further optimization.
